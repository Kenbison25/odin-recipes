        <h1>Horchata!</h1>
         <!-- Needed: Image of Horchata made for LI -->
    
        <h2>The scrumptious horchata you will learn to make!</h2>

         <p>So you want to make some horchata? Well... you've come to the right spot! Simple to make, 
            with the only main requirement being time, you will master the art of the horchata 
            in no time, a la Carranzini. Let's get started!</p>

        <p>What will you need? Here is the rundown:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>White Long-Grain Rice</li>
            <li>Cinammon Sticks</li>
            <li>Milk (Any kind works but I prefer whole)</li>
            <li>Star Anise</li>
            <li>Sweetened Condensed Melk</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>Almonds (OPTIONAL! - For the Allergic Folks)</li>
            <li>A stove (or some way to toast stuff lightly)</li>
            <li>Something to toast the stuff on (like a pan!)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You see there is a lack of numbers and quanitites, and this is because we are all making different
            amounts for different situations. So I will give you a ratio.
        </p>
        <p><strong>The Golden Ratio for Horchata is 4 Cinammon Sticks and a Star Anise per Cup of Rice.
        </strong></p>
        <p>(If you're gonna add almonds it's 1/4 cup per 2 cups of Rice)</p>

        <p>With this combination you shall never fail! Now follow the order of the recipe below!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the White Rice, Cinammon Sticks (Almonds if there)</li>
            <li>Once  you toast it to a light golden brown, put the toasted items into a large bowl or 
                some kind of stock pot, and fill up the stock pot with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>Sit for anytime between 6-24 hours (more time, the deeper the flavor!)</li>
            <li>Once you're ready, dump into a blender, add sweetened condensed milk to taste. Also add
                Vanilla Extract to taste.</li>
            <li>Blend items until all cinammon is grined out. You will need a decently strong blender for this. 
                (I use the Costco Ninja ones and it works wonders lmao)
            </li>
            <li>Strain using cheese cloth and/or Strainer (Usually I just do the strainer).</li>
            <li>Add Milk and Water to taste. Milk makes it creamier, water makes it more refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>You're ready to serve!</li>
        </ol>
